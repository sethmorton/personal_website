				I'm a passionate software engineer who started my journey at age 12 by building my own
				photography website (because who wants to pay for Wix?). That spark of creation hasn't
				stopped since - I've gone on to build 40+ projects that tackle meaningful challenges in
				unique ways.

				Currently, I'm crafting solutions at Renavest to make financial therapy more accessible and
				help people build healthier relationships with money. When I'm not coding, you'll find me
				exploring Boston's neighborhoods on my bike, diving deep into geothermal energy research
				(it's fascinating!), or working through new ideas that keep my mind racing.

				I believe in the power of both code and philosophy to solve complex challenges - that's why
				I'm studying both at Tufts. My experience spans the full development stack, with particular
				expertise in Node.js ecosystems. But what really drives me? Creating technology that makes a
				genuine difference in people's lives.
