What are Ideologies?
AN INTRODUCTION

What are Ideologies?

Deviant Conception of Ideology

Marxian Conception of Ideology

Positivist Conception of Ideology

Deviant Conception of Ideology
Reflects ordinary usage.
Highly closed and detached from reality.
Passionate or deeply emotional, even zealous commitment.
Radical, totalitarian political views.

Marxian Conception of Ideology
Presented by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their book The German

Ideology (1846).

Two Key Features of Ideology:
 Ideology reflects particular socio-economic practices in a deceptive manner.
 Pejorative connotation: exhibits false consciousness.

Marxian Conception of Ideology
Historical Materialism – The features that make up the material

conditions of society and individuals’ lives influence the social and
political aspects of society.
 Individuals’ “life processes”: the production and satisfaction of our basic needs.

Economic base refers to how these needs are satisfied.
Superstructure - The non-economic beliefs, norms, and conventions

that comprise a society.
 Politics, law, religion, metaphysical beliefs, culture, etc.

Mode(s) of Production

Mode of Production:
 Means of Production – Materials (raw and created), labor, and technology used for

the production of material goods (food, clothes, shelter).
 Relations of Production – The social and economic relations that govern the
production of material goods.

Different periods of history have different modes of production.

Capitalist Relations of Production

Capitalists – Owners of the means of production.
 Control over the production process.
 Receive full profits.

Laborers – Produce the material goods.
 No control over the production process.
 Receive wages.

Marxian Conception of Ideology
 Ideology reflects the class interests between the classes in society.

 In a capitalist society, the dominant ideology reflects the interests of the

capitalist class in maintaining the capitalist mode of production.

 Examples found in the superstructure:
 Legal system: Laws such as the New Poor Law (1834); various Labor Statues.
 Enforcement of Justice: privileges for rich.
 Cultural: beliefs in the “naturalness” of economic laws/system.

Marxian Conception of Ideology
Ideology functions as a distorting mechanism in society.

Members of society experience false consciousness.
 Mistake appearances for reality.
 Class interests constituting the superstructure are hidden from laborers.

Example: the “naturalness” of the capitalist economic system.

Positivist Understanding of Ideology
“No longer is ideology regarded as an aberration of perception or of

understanding” (15).
“Value free” approach to the study of ideologies
 The aim is not evaluative but classificatory.

Ideologies are widespread social phenomenon: organized systems of

political ideas incorporating beliefs, attitudes, and opinions.

Positivist Understanding of Ideology
Functionalist approach: focuses on their function in society.
 Support or contest political arrangements.
 Provide plans of action of public policy.
 Binding of communities.

The aim of classifying rather than evaluating leads to more of an

emphasis on the consumption and expression of ideologies rather than
their creation.

What are Ideologies?
The building blocks of ideologies are political concepts.
Ideologies are collections of political concepts.
How do ideologies differ?
 (1) They include different political concepts.
 (2) They interpret the same political concepts in different ways.
 (3) The locations of specific political concepts within the entire morphological

structure.

Political Concepts
How is it possible to interpret the same political concepts differently?

Political concepts are “essentially contested concepts.”
 By their nature, such concepts inevitably lead to disagreement as to how they should

be understood.

Essentially Contested Concepts
Internally Complex – Concepts are made up of different “parts” that

determine its meaning (its intension).
 The range of components to be included within (and excluded from) the concept.
 How to understand each of those components.
 The priority attached to each of the components.

Appraisive – Concepts signify or are attributed some value or disvalue.

Political Concepts
Political concept: equality.

Equality of opportunity may be one component included with this

political concept (equality of outcome; legal/political equality;
economic equality).

Equality of opportunity is itself indeterminate and contested.


Formal vs. substantive.

Political Concepts
Ineliminable Component – Not intrinsic to or logically necessary to the

meaning of the word but results from usage.
 All known usages of concept employ this component.
 Political concepts cannot be reduced to their ineliminable component(s).

Quasi-Contingent Categories – Additional components of a concept

that comprise necessary categories.
 Necessary for understanding the ineliminable component.

Political Concepts
Example: concept of a table
 Ineliminable Component: raised surface
 Quasi-Contingent Categories: material of surface, color, the manner in which the

surface is raised.

Example: concept of freedom/liberty
 Ineliminable Component: non-constraint
 Who is non-constrained? By what? From what?
 Quasi-Contingent Categories: the notion of a subject, the notion of obstruction,

obstructing from what.

Logical Adjacency

Logical Adjacency - Concepts represent specific interpretations of the

necessary categories involved in the concept that they are adjacent to.
Quasi-contingent categories are logically necessary to define the IC.
Therefore, other concepts can become logically adjacent to the IC of the

first concept.
 Ex: Concept of self-development is a way of filling in the “obstructing from what”

quasi-contingent category of freedom.

Two Types of Cultural Adjacency

Cultural Adjacency – “Cultural adjacency is a choice over which

branches of a logical tree to climb, given that we cannot climb them all
simultaneously” (70).
1st Type – Determines the logical path by which the quasi-contingent

categories of a concept are interpreted.
2nd Type – Determines what concepts are linked within a given cultural

context, irrespective of whether the connections are illogical.

Morphology of Ideologies
Core Concepts  Adjacent Concepts  Peripheral Concepts
Core Concepts – Most important for identifying ideologies. Different

members of the same ideological families will have generally similar
(family resemblances) cores.

Ideologies
Adjacent Concepts – These are concepts that are adjacent to the core,

and secondary in importance.
 Should not be confused with quasi-contingent adjacency.

Peripheral Concepts:
 Marginal Concepts – Concepts that are lacking in importance for a family of

ideologies.
 Perimeter Concepts – Concepts located in specific historical, geographical, and
cultural contexts.


Specific policy proposals.

New Liberalism

Liberal Morphology
• Core Concepts:

• Adjacent Concepts:

• Freedom

• The State

• Self-development

• Equality

(individuality)

• Progress
• Rationality
• The Common Good
• Power

• Democracy

Positive Freedom
• “ ‘freedom’ does not mean that the [person] or will is undetermined,

nor yet does it mean mere self-determination…It means a
particular kind of self-determination” (181-82).

• Freedom “is not constituted by the mere fact of acting upon

preference, but depends wholly on the nature of the preference,
upon the kind of object willed or preferred” (182).

• By freedom “we mean a positive power or capacity of doing

something worth doing” (186).

Freedom and Self-Development
• What are these objectively valuable things worth doing?

• The concept of self-development (similar to Mill’s individuality)

helps interpret the “proper” exercise of freedom.
 Freedom is not “wants-related.”

• Negative Freedom – No external constraints/interference.

• Positive Freedom – No internal constraints/interference.

 Our actions should reflect our “true selves.”

Freedom and Self-Development
• Self-development helps interpret freedom, but freedom also places limits on the

concept of self-development.

• Green rejects the use of laws and coercion to force self-development.

• Illiberal laws can make self-development more diffi cult to pursue and achieve.

 (1) Can limit citizens’ routes to self-development by closing off options.
 (2) Worsen the intentions of citizens.
 (3) Weakens their self-direction.

The Common Good
• (1) Society (through the state) provides the necessary means by which individuals can

pursue self-development.

 Does not coerce citizens into acting for the betterment of the common good.
 Rights protect citizens freedom to act otherwise.

• (2) Recognition of others as persons and the need for their self-development.

• (3) Self-development benefits the common good.

 “Liberation of powers implies the unleashing and consequent natural working out of human
potential. That potential is made available for social purposes…” (188).
 When citizens pursue and achieve their self-development, they will contribute to society.

The Role of the State
• The connection between self-development and the community makes the state

an important adjacent concept within liberal theory.

• The ineliminable component of freedom, non-constraint, now more strongly

included the absences of social and economic obstacles impeding selfdevelopment.

• Service understanding of the state.

 Doesn’t merely protect freedom from interference by others.
 While it does not compel self-development, it has an obligation to provide the
resources and conditions necessary to allow for its pursuit.

Changing Perimeter Concepts
• Freedom, self-development, community  State as a service  Specific policies.

• Cultural conditions, such as the effects of industrialization on the laboring

population, also contributed to the support of specific policies.

• The “Progressive Era” in the United States (approx. 1900-1920) emphasized very

specific definitions of economic freedom.
 Workers sought to unionize, improvements in wages and working conditions, a
“living wage,” and democracy in the working place.
 Regulation of corporations, overseeing of safety and health conditions.

Changing Perimeter Concepts
• Roosevelt’s New Deal (implementation of liberal ideas):

• Social Security Act (1935) – unemployment insurance, old age pensions, aid to the disabled

and to dependent children.

• Public Works Program
• Wagner Act (1935) – Allowed workers collective bargaining rights.
• Wealth Tax Act (1935) – Income tax of 79% on incomes over $5 million.
• Fair Standards Labor Act (1938) – Implementation of minimum wage, 40-hour work weeks,

8-hour workdays, overtime eligibility, child labor standards.

Changing Perimeter Concepts
• The concept of property moved from an adjacent position to a marginal one.

 The behavior of corporations had to be regulated.
 The scope of property rights were specified by conventions of the state; they were not
natural rights.

• Freedom of contract was not viewed as an exercise of individual freedom.

 Greater sensitivity to inequalities of power in bargaining between workers and
employers.

The Role of the State
• The changing role of the state brings liberalism and socialism closer

together.

• It distances (new) liberalism from classical

liberalism/libertarianism.


Libertarianism
SIT DOLOR AMET

Libertarianism
Core Concepts:
 Freedom
 Private Property
 Power (as security)

Freedom and Property
 Like classical liberals, libertarians restrict freedom to the idea of non-

interference by others.

 The classical liberal defense of property rights tends to be
instrumental.
 Libertarians interpret individuals’ freedom as property rights.
 Exercises of freedom become ways of exercising property rights.

Self-Ownership & Property Rights
 The idea of self-ownership claims that we have property/ownership rights

over our bodies, talents, and labor.

 These self-ownership rights are identical to extra-personal property rights.
 They are the same as the property rights we acquire over any object.
 Central to property rights are control rights.
 If self-ownership rights are property rights, then those rights are also
alienable.

Power
 Power is to be used for protecting individuals’ (property) rights.
 Self-ownership and property rights create obligations on the parts of others
(including the state) not to interfere with owners’ decisions as to the use of
their property.
 These rights carry absolute value.
 Power is to be used for the enforcement of contractual agreements.

Freedom and Property
 Unlike classical liberals, libertarians do not appeal to economic
liberalism/efficiency considerations to justify the protection of
freedom and property.
 Concepts of progress and growth are marginalized in the
libertarian morphology.
 The protection of freedom and property stems from a desire to treat
citizens with dignity by respecting their choices and decisions.
 Provides a Kantian basis.

Libertarianism
Adjacent and Perimeter Concepts:
 Equality
 Self-regulating Markets
 Open Immigration
 Abortion

Equality
 Political and legal equality before the law.
 Classical liberalism supported a formal conception of equality of
opportunity.
 Liberalism supported a substantive conception of equality of
opportunity.
 Libertarianism rejects even the formal conception of equality of

Distribution of Wealth & Income
 Classical liberals defend economic freedoms on efficiency considerations.

 This means interfering with some market distributions to prevent the rise
of monopolies.

 For libertarians, the core status of freedom as property and power lead to
a commitment to self-regulating markets.
 The distribution of wealth & income is to be decided entirely by citizens’
free choices.

Distribution of Wealth & Income
 Redistribution through taxation is prohibited.

 Generally, all forms of taxation are prohibited.
 Welfare programs, public education, etc. would all be
prohibited.

Other Perimeter Concepts
 The absolute commitment to freedom leads to the support of open
immigration policies.
 The absolute commitment to freedom leads to the support of
abortion rights.
 The absolute commitment to freedom leads to the legalization of all
drugs.

LIBERALISM

FIVE VARIANTS OF LIBERALISM
• “Millite” Liberalism
• New Liberalism
• Philosophical Liberalism (American academic philosophy)
• Classical Liberalism (Old liberalism)
• Libertarianism

THE LIBERAL CORE
• Freedom/Liberty
• Individuality
• Progress
• Human Nature/Rationality
• Sociability
• Power

FREEDOM/LIBERTY
• Ineliminable Component: non-constraint
• Quasi-Contingent Categories:
• What/who does the constraining? The actions of other individuals (through
force and coercion).

• Negative Conception of Liberty = Non-interference
• Protection for liberty of expression and liberty of action.

FREEDOM/LIBERTY
• Individuals should be free to pursue their own good in their own way.
• Goes beyond non-interference by others and by the state.

• “liberty is not merely self-determination, but the subset of selfdetermination known as self-development” (147).

• The key thing here is that Mill’s understanding of the “good” is objective
rather than purely subjective.

INDIVIDUALITY
• Ineliminable Component: The notion of the person as a separate entity
possessing unique attributes and capable of choice.

• What is good for human beings is the free development of our
individuality.
• Individuality does not exclusively mean uniqueness.

• The harmonious development of our rational capacities.
• Mill’s famous distinction between higher activities and lower activities.

FREEDOM AND INDIVIDUALITY
• The concept of individuality helps interpret the concept of freedom.
• Fills in the quasi-contingent category: freedom for what purpose?

• Freedom is not just a matter of doing whatever we want, without others
interfering with our actions.

• Certain exercises of freedom are preferred over other exercises.

• Freedom helps interpret individuality: must be the free development of
individuality.

• Cannot employ legal coercion.

THE CONCEPT OF PROGRESS
• Ineliminable Component: movement from less to more desirable state

• Quasi-Contingent Categories:
• (1) How does the movement occur?
• (2) How do we determine less and more desirable states?

THE CONCEPT OF PROGRESS
• Question 1: How does movement occur?
• Possible explanations: Mechanical/evolutionary, materialist, determinist,
superimposed.

• The other core concepts will help interpret the idea of progress.
• The concept of freedom is how liberalism interprets this aspect of
progress.

• Progress must be achieved through freedom.

THE CONCEPT OF PROGRESS
• Question 2: How do we determine less and more desirable states?
• The concept of individuality will interpret this aspect of progress.
• More desirable states are states in which individuals have

developed their individuality, i.e. the harmonious development of
their rational capacities.

HUMAN NATURE/RATIONALITY
• Human nature is rational and sociable.
• What is meant by “rational” and “sociable”?
• We have to look to the other core concepts to determine how to
interpret the concept of rationality within the liberal core.

• Rationality is connected to the core concepts of individuality,
progress, and sociability.

HUMAN NATURE/RATIONALITY
• (1) Rationality as a means: form of correct reasoning, evaluation of
states of affairs.
• Here rationality is understood in terms of technocracy and the applications
of social sciences to social matters. The “rationalization” of society.

• (2) Rationality as an end: development of human powers, of
individuality, harmony within the individual.
• Here rationality is connected to progress on an individual level, in terms of
individuality.

SOCIABILITY
• Ineliminable Component: mutual regard for the interests of others and
promotion of general welfare of the community.

• Mill does emphasize sociability and sympathy within his moral and
political theories.

• Sometimes liberalism is seen as being very individualistic.
• What about now?

POWER
• From a liberal perspective power is both necessary and
dangerous.

• Necessary for preserving the freedom of individuals and the
development of individuality.

• Some power must be exercised by the state; otherwise, we end
up in a lawless society.

POWER
• Dangerous as too much power can encroach on that very freedom.
• The core concept of freedom generates the need to ensure that power is
properly limited while remaining beneficial.

• The concepts of individuality and rationality also function to interpret
the proper use of power.

• Power does not simply mean protection from interference; power has to be
used for promoting citizens’ individuality.

• Attributes more functions to the state.

POWER, RATIONALITY, AND PROGRESS
• Recap: Increased rationality is the goal.
• Societal level: inclusion of different groups within the group of citizens.
• Individual level: a more harmonious life centered about the use of our
rational capacities.

• Rationality serves as the means by which progress comes about.
• Social sciences help us learn more about the institutional and systemic
flaws and injustices of society.

• Power can be harnessed through the social sciences and the economy to
develop reforms and policies to address those injustices.

ADJACENT CONCEPTS

• Democracy
• Equality
• Property

THE MIXED FACES OF DEMOCRACY
• Why does democracy occupy only an adjacent rather than a core
position?
• To what extent does its status change within liberal theory?

• Mill had mixed views regarding democracy.
• Conducive to both freedom and the development of individuality and
progress.

• Worried about the possibility of tyranny by the social and political
majorities.

DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM
• (1) Democracy understood as an expression of political freedom.
• Benjamin Constant: liberty of the ancients vs. liberty of the moderns.
• Roots in Ancient Greece, where civic participation in politics was seen as a very important
expression of freedom.

• Alexander Tocqueville: Emphasizes the opportunity for political participation at the local
level.

• (2) Democracy understood as an expression of freedom as self-determination.
• (3) Democratic governments typically preserve and promote individual
freedoms better than other forms of government.

DEMOCRACY, INDIVIDUALITY, AND
PROGRESS
• Participatory aspects of democracy (should) develop individuals’
mental and moral faculties.
• Avoids group polarization and increases toleration of other viewpoints.

• Participation promotes progress.
• As more individuals develop their individuality, democracy would move into
a core position.

THE DANGEROUS SIDE OF DEMOCRACY
• The problem of democratic citizenship: the citizenry, as a whole, is
largely uneducated, prejudiced, irrational, and self-interested.

• Could threaten the freedom and individuality of minority groups
through social, political, and legal tyranny.

• Political power, freedom, and individuality all had to be protected.

THE DANGEROUS SIDE: QUALIFYING
SUFFRAGE
• Democracy was a balancing act between political rights of
the masses and elitism.

• Popular vote had to be tempered by qualifying suffrage in
different ways.
• 1830s: Mill did not think universal suffrage was appropriate yet.
• 1861: Mill’s Considerations on Representative Government - argued that
everyone should have a vote, but that the more educated should have
more votes.

THE DANGEROUS SIDE: QUALIFYING
SUFFRAGE
• The American Case:
• The Revolution witnessed an expansion of the ability to participate
in politics.
• Abolishment (Pennsylvania) / relaxation of property qualifications.
• Emphasized the social conditions of freedom and the ability to acquire
property.

THE DANGEROUS SIDE: QUALIFYING
SUFFRAGE
• American Constitution represented a retreat from the Revolution.
• James Madison structured the government to prevent any single economic interest from
achieving power (and to make unequal concentrations of property immune from
governmental interference).
• States were prevented from abridging property rights and qualifications.

• 1820-1830s most states began abolishing property qualifications; not completed until 1860.
• African Americans technically in 1870 (15 Amendment).
th

• Women in 1920.

THE DANGEROUS SIDE: REPRESENTATION
• Structure of U.S. government prevented direct democracy.
• Formation of Electoral College
• Citizens voted for electors who then discussed among themselves for
president.

• Purpose was to filter opinions of the public.
• Only in 1824 was popular vote used as a guide for electors.

EQUALITY
• What it is:
• A moral conception of worth.
• Equal legal and political rights, opportunities for development.
• Reduced social and economic inequalities (viewed as irrelevant differences that
hamper the development of individuality).

• Equality of opportunity becomes interpreted in substantive rather than merely
formal terms.

• What it isn’t:
• Equality of sameness.
• Equality of result/outcome.
• Leveling down.

PROPERTY
• The benefits:
• Necessary to incentivize work.
• Necessary for the exercise of freedom and the development of individuality.

• The dangers:
• The concentration of property could have a detrimental effect on the
development of individuality.

• Too much of an emphasis on property would interfere with the positive
aspects of state power.


CLASSICAL
LIBERALISM

-- TWO VERSIONS OF LIBERTARIANISM -• (1) Libertarianism as classical liberalism.
• Combines aspects of “economic liberalism” and utilitarianism.
• It is now referred to classical liberalism or old liberalism.
• Would have viewed themselves as being true to the liberal tradition.

• (2) Contemporary versions of libertarianism.
• Pushes classical liberalism to more “extreme” conclusions.
• Justifications less rooted in efficiency considerations found in economic theory.
• Both have some similarities with conservatism.

-- CLASSICAL LIBERALISM -• Core Concepts:

• Adjacent Concepts:

• Freedom

• Progress

• Individuality

• Evolutionary Theory

• Human Nature

• The State

• Property

• Equality

• Power

• Democracy

-- FREEDOM -• Classical liberalism adopts only the negative aspect of non-constraint.
• Others (including the government) should not interfere with our
actions through force or coercion.
• Rejects both positive freedom and construing constraints as
referring to social and economic circumstances.

-- FREEDOM -• Friedrich Hayek: Freedom “describes the absence of a particular obstacle—coercion
by other men” (303).
• “By ‘coercion’ we mean such control of the environment or circumstances of a person
by another” (303).
• “Freedom thus presupposes that the individual has some assured private sphere, that
there is some sphere of circumstances in his environment with which others cannot
interfere” (305).
• Herbert Spencer: Freedom is being “left secure in person and possessions to satisfy
[one’s] wants with the proceeds” (286).

-- HUMAN NATURE -• Self-interested, competitive, and entrepreneurial (initiative and risk
taking, creative).

• Engage in maximizing behavior:
• Pleasure, desire-satisfaction, or financial gain.

-- INDIVIDUALITY AS INDIVIDUALISM -• Self-development drops out of the picture.
• Subjectivity and diversity of uniqueness, tastes, pleasures, etc. are the
focus.
• Connects to a wants-related conception of freedom.

• Atomistic conception of society and individuals.
• Individuals are seen as separate and self-dependent.

-- PRIVATE PROPERTY -• Property rights protect individuals from both the state and others by
giving them exclusive control over objects.
• Core of property rights: control rights = up to the owner to determine
what is done with or to the property.
• Emphasis on freedom of contract.
• 1905 Lochner v. New York U.S. Supreme Court Case.

-- PRIVATE PROPERTY -• Property also had/has an important connection to political freedom.
• Particularly for American revolutionaries, the possession of property
(and with it economic security) implied independence of political thought.
• John Adams: Those without property had no “judgment of their own.
They talk and vote as they are directed by some man of property.”
• Classical liberals also emphasize the importance of private property
rights in ensuring a free press.

-- POWER -• Classical liberalism views power as a product of the direct actions of
others: other individuals and the state.
• Rejection of “informal” power.

• Some use of power is necessary for protection of individual rights,
especially property rights.
• The use of power is mitigated by concerns about the overreach of the
state, especially in economic affairs.

-- ADJACENT CONCEPTS -• Progress
• Evolution
• The State
• Equality
• Democracy

-- EQUALITY -• Liberalism: the connection to Mill’s individuality/Green’s self-development
led to a substantive conception of equality.
• Not only are individuals equal before the law, but they should have
equal opportunities for self-development, which meant reducing
social and economic inequalities.
• Classical liberalism: emphasizes a more formal conception of equality.
• What is important is only political and legal equality before the law.

-- PROGRESS -• The Goals: Interpreted in terms of wealth accumulation, consumption,
and improvement of material goods.
• Also includes less poverty, less infant mortality, higher literacy rates,
higher life expectancy, better quality of life overall.
• The Means: Progress comes from the self-interested, wealth-seeking,
creative, entrepreneurial behavior of individuals.
• Attempts to satisfy consumer needs/wants  leads to innovation and
progress  competition  further innovation and progress.

-- PROGRESS -• All brought about through capitalism.
• Grants more freedom to individuals through private property rights.
• Incentivizes entrepreneurial behavior and risk taking.
• Most efficient system for the allocation and distribution of resources.

• Invisible-Hand Arguments:
• Progress is achieved indirectly through the self-interested actions of individuals.
• Rejection of intentional planning by the state.

-- THE STATE -• Freedom, property, and progress all help to interpret the role of the state.
• State as a service vs. state as “night watchman”/umpire
• Does not play an active role in reforming society.
• Ensures everyone follows the rules to ensure a competitive market.
• By protecting individual freedom and property rights, state unleashes
individual creativity to benefit all of society.

-- EVOLUTIONARY THEORY -• Liberalism: human rationality was an evolutionary development on the
social/group level.
• State power could be used to solve social problems.
• Classical liberalism: human rationality was an evolutionary development on
the individual level.
• Social Darwinism.
• Reinforces importance of individual freedom as non-interference.
